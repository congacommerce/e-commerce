# Digital Commerce Core Reference Template

This is the base reference application for the apttus ecommerce product. Follow the below instructions to get started. See https://cmoyle336.github.io/sdk-docs/overview.html for more detailed instructions on interacting with
the underlying SDK.

## Deploy the unmanaged package
Find the zip file named 'unmanaged-package.zip' and deploy it to your org. (Will become a managed package in the near future)

## Install the application
In a terminal window run
```bash
npm install
```

## Sentry Logging
Sentry will be installed and running and, if you run into errors, you may see a popup asking for feedback. You can disable this in your src/app/salesforce.config.ts file with the following flags:

```json
{
    enableErrorLogging : false
    enableErrorReporting: false
}
```

## Enable/disable localization
If you do not have multi-currency enabled in your org, you must turn off multi-currency support in your storefront in the src/app/salesforce.config.ts file.
```json
{
    enableMultiCurrency : false
}
```

## Setup the proxy for local development
In the root directory, there is a file named 'proxy.config.json'. This allows you to make SOAP API calls from your local development server (for functionality like login and reprice cart). Populate the 'target' attributes in that file with the instance url of your community.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Deploy to your salesforce org
In a terminal window run
```bash
npm run deploy
```


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
